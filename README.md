Java program that encodes a text file to ~60% of its original size. The program uses a Huffman Tree to compress data into a 
more compact form. This occurs in the HuffmanEncode.java file. 

There is also a file, HuffmanDecode.java, that will take a compressed file, and uncompress it, back to its original size.

How to use:
In the terminal of choice, to encode, compile the program by typing javac HuffmanEncode.java. Run the program by typing
java HuffmanEncode. (Note: In the HuffmanEncode.java there is a text file that's included in the project that will be compressed. If a different file is to be compressed, add the text file to the project folder, and change the name of the text file in the main function.)

To decode; simply compile the HuffmanDecode by typing javac HuffmanDecode.java and execute it by typing java HuffmanDecode.
(Note: The file being decompressed is the sample file that was compressed from the encode. This can be changed by typing the name of the text file to decode in the HuffmanDecode.java main section.
